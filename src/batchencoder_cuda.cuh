    /**
    Provides functionality for CRT batching. If the polynomial modulus degree is N, and
    the plaintext modulus is a prime number T such that T is congruent to 1 modulo 2N,
    then BatchEncoder allows the plaintext elements to be viewed as 2-by-(N/2)
    matrices of integers modulo T. Homomorphic operations performed on such encrypted
    matrices are applied coefficient (slot) wise, enabling powerful SIMD functionality
    for computations that are vectorizable. This functionality is often called "batching"
    in the homomorphic encryption literature.

    @par Mathematical Background
    Mathematically speaking, if the polynomial modulus is X^N+1, N is a power of two, and
    plain_modulus is a prime number T such that 2N divides T-1, then integers modulo T
    contain a primitive 2N-th root of unity and the polynomial X^N+1 splits into n distinct
    linear factors as X^N+1 = (X-a_1)*...*(X-a_N) mod T, where the constants a_1, ..., a_n
    are all the distinct primitive 2N-th roots of unity in integers modulo T. The Chinese
    Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that the plaintext space Z_T[X]/(X^N+1) in this case is
    isomorphic (as an algebra) to the N-fold direct product of fields Z_T. The isomorphism
    is easy to compute explicitly in both directions, which is what this class does.
    Furthermore, the Galois group of the extension is (Z/2NZ)* ~= Z/2Z x Z/(N/2) whose
    action on the primitive roots of unity is easy to describe. Since the batching slots
    correspond 1-to-1 to the primitive roots of unity, applying Galois automorphisms on the
    plaintext act by permuting the slots. By applying generators of the two cyclic
    subgroups of the Galois group, we can effectively view the plaintext as a 2-by-(N/2)
    matrix, and enable cyclic row rotations, and column rotations (row swaps).

    @par Valid Parameters
    Whether batching can be used depends on whether the plaintext modulus has been chosen
    appropriately. Thus, to construct a BatchEncoder the user must provide an instance
    of SEALContext such that its associated EncryptionParameterQualifiers object has the
    flags parameters_set and enable_batching set to true.

    @see EncryptionParameters for more information about encryption parameters.
    @see EncryptionParameterQualifiers for more information about parameter qualifiers.
    @see Evaluator for rotating rows and columns of encrypted matrices.
